1. Intro to Linux

- Open-source operating system based on Unix.

- Known for stability, security, and flexibility.

- Used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems.

- Primarily uses a command-line interface (CLI), but GUIs are available.

- Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian) offer different user experiences.

2. Getting Familiar with the Command Line

- Terminal (CLI) is the primary interface for interacting with Linux.

- Used for file management, running programs, and system configuration.

- More efficient than GUIs for many tasks once you're familiar.

- Essential for advanced Linux usage and system administration.

3. File Management

- Linux file system is hierarchical (directories within directories).

- Core tasks include navigating, creating, deleting, copying, and moving files.

- Files and directories have specific permissions (read, write, execute).

- Permissions control access and security for different users.

4. Algorithms and Software Engineering

- Linux is a popular environment for software development and engineering.

- Used for coding, compiling, testing, and debugging applications.

- Supports many programming languages like C, Python, Java, and more.

- Tools available for version control (e.g., Git) and debugging.

- Software engineering principles such as code refactoring and testing are vital.

5. File Editing

- File editing in Linux can be done with command-line or graphical editors.

- Popular command-line editors: vim, nano, emacs.

- Used for editing code, configuration files, system logs, and scripts.

- Command-line editors are powerful and efficient for programming tasks.

6. Linux Security
- Objective: Protect the Linux system and its data from unauthorized access, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- Authentication Methods:
  - Use strong passwords or SSH keys for secure authentication.
  - Set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.
- Firewalls:
  - Tools like iptables or ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) allow for controlling network traffic, allowing you to block or permit specific traffic.
- Regular Updates:
  - Regularly update the system with security patches to fix vulnerabilities. Commands like apt-get update and yum update are used to update package repositories and install security patches.
- Monitoring:
  - Use system logs (located in /var/log/) to monitor activities and detect any suspicious activity.
  - Tools like Fail2ban can automatically ban IPs attempting brute force attacks.
- Encryption:
  - Use tools like GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) to encrypt data at rest.
  - Enable full disk encryption during system installation for additional security.

7. User and Group Creation
- Creating Users:
  - useradd <username>: Adds a new user to the system. By default, no password is assigned, so use passwd <username> to set one.
  - Example: useradd john
- Creating Groups:
  - groupadd <groupname>: Adds a new group, which can be used to manage permissions collectively.
  - Example: groupadd developers
- Modifying Users:
  - usermod <options> <username>: Modify user details like group membership, home directory, etc.
  - Example: usermod -aG developers john
- Managing Passwords:
  - passwd <username>: Set or change the password for a user.
  - Example: passwd john

8. User Ownership and Permissions
- Every file has an owner and a group.
- Permissions control access:
  - Read (r): View the content.
  - Write (w): Modify the content.
  - Execute (x): Run the file or script.
- Changing Permissions:
  - chmod <permissions> <file>: Use chmod to change file permissions.
  - Example: chmod 755 file.txt
- Changing Ownership:
  - chown <user>:<group> <file>: Changes the ownership of a file.
  - Example: chown john:developers file.txt
- Changing Group Ownership:
  - chgrp <group> <file>: Changes the group ownership of a file.
  - Example: chgrp developers file.txt

9. Linux Networking
- Set up network interfaces with ifconfig or ip.
  - ifconfig or ip: View and configure network interfaces.
  - Example: ip addr show
- Configure static or dynamic IP addresses.
  - Use DHCP to automatically get an IP address or manually configure a static IP.
  - Example: ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0
- Use ping to check connectivity:
  - ping <destination>: Send network packets to test connectivity.
  - Example: ping 8.8.8.8
- netstat to view active connections:
  - netstat -tuln: Shows listening ports and active connections.
  - Example: netstat -tuln
- Use traceroute to trace network routes:
  - traceroute <destination>: Trace the path packets take to a remote host.
  - Example: traceroute google.com
- nslookup to query DNS records:
  - nslookup <domain>: Query DNS servers for IP addresses of a domain.
  - Example: nslookup google.com

10. Inter Process Communication
- Mechanisms that allow processes to communicate with each other:
  - Pipes, message queues, and shared memory.
- Monitoring Processes:
  - ps <options>: View running processes.
  - Example: ps aux
- Sending Signals to Processes:
  - kill <PID>: Terminate a process by sending a signal (default signal is SIGTERM).
  - Example: kill 1234
- Background and Foreground Processes:
  - bg: Move a process to the background.
  - fg: Bring a process to the foreground.
  - Example: bg %1, fg %1

11. Disk Usage and Working with Multiple Files
- Check Disk Usage:
  - df <options>: Displays disk space usage on all mounted filesystems.
  - Example: df -h
- Check Directory and File Sizes:
  - du <options>: Displays the size of files and directories.
  - Example: du -sh /home/user
- Archiving Files:
  - tar <options>: Create, view, and extract file archives.
  - Example: tar -czf archive.tar.gz file1 file2
- Compressing Files:
  - gzip or bzip2: Compress files to save disk space.
  - Example: gzip file.txt
- Working with Multiple Files:
  - cp <source> <destination>: Copy files.
  - mv <source> <destination>: Move or rename files.
